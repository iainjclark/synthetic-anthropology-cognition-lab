# synthetic-anthropology-cognition-lab
Research lab notebook and code for synthetic anthropology experiments using LLMs: structured cross-cultural dialogues, prompt protocols, evaluation rubrics, and logs/analysis for reproducible experiments. Conceptually grounded in Turchin &amp; Nefedov, Secular Cycles (2009), and extended with human–AI interactions.
